# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

## Description
This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic game "Rock-Paper-Scissors" in Python. The user can play against the computer, and the winner is determined based on the choices made by both the user and the computer.

## How to Play
1. Run the Python script "RockPaperScissors.py" using any Python interpreter.
2. When prompted, enter your choice by typing either "rock," "paper," or "scissors" (without quotes) and press Enter.
3. The computer will randomly choose its action.
4. The script will display the user's choice and the computer's choice.
5. The winner will be announced, or it will be a tie if both the user and the computer make the same choice.
6. After each round, you will be asked if you want to play again. Type "y" and press Enter to play again, or type "n" to exit the game.
